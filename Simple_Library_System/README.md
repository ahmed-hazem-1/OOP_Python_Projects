# Library Management System

## Overview

The Library Management System is a Python-based application designed to facilitate the management of a library's inventory and membership. It provides essential functionalities to handle books and members, including adding new books and members, lending and returning books, and viewing lists of books and members.

## Features

- **Add Books:** Register new books with title, author, and ISBN.
- **Add Members:** Enroll new library members with their name and ID.
- **Lend Books:** Loan books to members, updating their status to borrowed.
- **Return Books:** Return borrowed books and update their status to available.
- **List Books:** Display all books in the library with their details.
- **List Members:** Display all registered members and their details.

## Project Structure

- **`book.py`**: Defines the `Book` class, which represents a book in the library.
- **`member.py`**: Defines the `Member` class, which represents a library member.
- **`library.py`**: Defines the `Library` class, which manages books and members and provides the functionality for adding, lending, and returning books.
