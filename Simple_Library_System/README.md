# Library Management System

## Overview

The Library Management System is a Python project designed to manage a library's books and members. It includes functionality for adding books and members, lending and returning books, and listing all books and members. The system is implemented using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, with classes representing books, members, and the library itself.

## Features

- **Add Books:** Add new books to the library with title, author, and ISBN.
- **Add Members:** Register new members with their name and unique member ID.
- **Lend Books:** Lend books to members, marking them as borrowed.
- **Return Books:** Return borrowed books, marking them as available.
- **List Books:** Display a list of all books in the library.
- **List Members:** Display a list of all registered members.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into three main Python files:

1. **`Book.py`** - Contains the `Book` class, which represents a book in the library.
2. **`Member.py`** - Contains the `Member` class, which represents a library member.
3. **`Library.py`** - Contains the `Library` class, which manages books and members, and provides methods for adding, lending, and returning books.
